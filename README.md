# Facial_expression_recognition

We can use a video from computer or webcam so that the app can recognize the expressions

The app can give feedback for upto six expressions which are: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral
Uses OpenCV to detect face and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to learn what the face is expressing and lateron on new data with new faces predict the expression.
Above is the video showing the expressions predictions of app for new data
I have used the 2013 Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset (https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/resources/FER-2013) for training the model
Tools used are tensorflow, python for creating the model, flask, python for creating the webapp
